## 📈 Launch Stats

- ⏱️ Time to build: **5 days** (2 days development, 3 days iteration & launch)
- 👥 Users: **2,681**
- 🔁 Swipes: **15,383** within 72 hours
- 🚀 Traffic: Hundreds of concurrent users during peak hours

## 🧠 Key Learnings

1. **Speed Matters**  
   Instead of overthinking, we built fast. Rapid prototyping helped validate our idea with real users.

2. **Iterate Quickly**  
   Post-launch, we listened to feedback, fixed bugs, and improved UI/UX continuously under live traffic.

3. **Scaling is Hard**  
   Early scaling issues like image hosting bottlenecks, database load, and slow API responses surfaced quickly. We introduced caching, optimized queries, and offloaded static content to improve performance.

## 💡 Challenges Faced

- Database scaling limits
- Image egress costs
- Slow response times under load
- Real-time matching logic with concurrent users

---

## 🔄 What Could Be Improved

- Better caching for profile images (e.g., CDN)
- Query optimization and indexing
- Smarter architecture (e.g., serverless or microservices)
- Load testing before release
